In hand
--------

PatternGuards : GHC D818

TemplateHaskell.hs 1 : Trac #10268

TypeBrackets : Trac #10255 D823
SlidingDoClause : Semi allowed in if stmt, need to only take it if inside the span

LiftedConstructors : Trac #10268

PuncFunctions : Trac #10268

TypeSynParens : Fix in Annotate.hs

GHC.Orig : fix rdrName2String in ghc-exactprint

AnnPackageName : fix in ghc-exactprint

NestedLambda : AnnLambda is in the GHC Anns attached to an AST span. Fix in ghc-exactprint

DefaultTypeInstance : fix in ghc-exactprint

MagicHash : HsCharPrim must always have a trailing '#' char. ghc-exactprint

GADTRecords : ghc-exactprint issue, anns are there.

MangledSemiLet : looks like annotations are ok, so ghc-exactprint issue

SlidingListComp : The AnnVbar in GRHS is capturing the annotation that belongs in the enclosed HsDo.
                - need to work around in ghc-exactprint

MultiImplicitParams : IPBinds provides its dbinds in reverse order. Fix in ghc-exactprint


GHC tickets still to be done
----------------------------

TemplateHaskell  2 : ITopenExpQuote can be either '[|' or '[e|'. Need to capture src
                   : workaround : the annotated SrcSpan is either 2 or 3 chars long.
                   Trac ticket #10276

Needs work
----------

Undefined : BooleanFormula is not implemented.

TupleSections : AnnComma missing, issue in Parser

MultiLineCommentWithPragmas : Lexer.x problem with nested #-}. Discards -} from it

DoubleForall : Annotation is added, but span is not in AST. Need to find the
            place where nested HsForAllTy's get collapsed, that is where we lose the span.


UnicodeSyntaxFailure : policy decision. Defer until others are resolved.
