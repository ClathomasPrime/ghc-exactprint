In hand
--------

PatternGuards : GHC D818

TemplateHaskell.hs 1 : Trac #10268

TypeBrackets : Trac #10255 D823

SlidingDoClause : Semi allowed in if stmt, need to only take it if inside the span

LiftedConstructors : Trac #10268

PuncFunctions : Trac #10269 / D832

TypeSynParens : Fix in Annotate.hs

GHC.Orig : fix rdrName2String in ghc-exactprint

AnnPackageName : fix in ghc-exactprint

NestedLambda : AnnLambda is in the GHC Anns attached to an AST span. Fix in ghc-exactprint

DefaultTypeInstance : fix in ghc-exactprint

MagicHash : HsCharPrim must always have a trailing '#' char. ghc-exactprint

GADTRecords : ghc-exactprint issue, anns are there.

MangledSemiLet : looks like annotations are ok, so ghc-exactprint issue

SlidingListComp : The AnnVbar in GRHS is capturing the annotation that belongs in the enclosed HsDo.
                - need to work around in ghc-exactprint

MultiImplicitParams : IPBinds provides its dbinds in reverse order. Fix in ghc-exactprint

UnicodeSyntaxFailure : workaround for the unicode.

See https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/master/compiler/parser/Lexer.x#L813

If Unicode is enabled, those tokens, which are normally >1 char long, are now 1
char long. We can use that to decide which string to output, pick it up in Delta
and modify our anns to include the string.

MultiLineCommentWithPragmas : Lexer.x problem with nested #-}. Discards -} from it
           D829

TupleSections : AnnComma missing, issue in Parser
           D834
           
DoubleForall : Annotation is added, but span is not in AST. Need to find the
            place where nested HsForAllTy's get collapsed, that is where we lose the span.
                #10278
          one option is D833
          
TemplateHaskell  2 : ITopenExpQuote can be either '[|' or '[e|'. Need to capture src
                   : workaround : the annotated SrcSpan is either 2 or 3 chars long.
                   Trac ticket #10276

Undefined : BooleanFormula is not implemented.

ListComprehensions.hs
  - Comma annotation attached to wrong AST element, of the line before.
    Trac #10312 / D846

TypeFamilies.hs
  fix in ghc-exactprint by sorting the potentially infix
  operations in an applyListAnnotations, as per GHC.SynDecl

Undefined.hs
Undefined6.hs
Undefined11.hs
Undefined12.hs

  {-# MINIMAL ... #-} Annotations are there, just not in a very user friendly
  space. Must wait until 7.12 for a proper fix.


TemplateHaskell.hs
  In ghc-exactprint, use the first argument of HsBracket to determine what
  string to use for AnnOpen
  
        | SIMPLEQUOTE  qvar     { sLL $1 $> $ HsBracket (VarBr True  (unLoc $2)) }
        | SIMPLEQUOTE  qcon     { sLL $1 $> $ HsBracket (VarBr True  (unLoc $2)) }
        | TH_TY_QUOTE tyvar     { sLL $1 $> $ HsBracket (VarBr False (unLoc $2)) }
        | TH_TY_QUOTE gtycon    { sLL $1 $> $ HsBracket (VarBr False (unLoc $2)) }
        | '[|' exp '|]'       {% ams (sLL $1 $> $ HsBracket (ExpBr $2)) [mo $1,mc $3] }
        | '[||' exp '||]'     {% ams (sLL $1 $> $ HsBracket (TExpBr $2)) [mo $1,mc $3]}
        | '[t|' ctype '|]'    {% checkNoPartialType
                                   (text "in type brackets" <> colon
                                    <+> quotes (text "[t|" <+> ppr $2 <+> text "|]")) $2 >>
                                 ams (sLL $1 $> $ HsBracket (TypBr $2)) [mo $1,mc $3] }
        | '[p|' infixexp '|]' {% checkPattern empty $2 >>= \p ->
                                      ams (sLL $1 $> $ HsBracket (PatBr p))
                                          [mo $1,mc $3] }
        | '[d|' cvtopbody '|]' {% ams (sLL $1 $> $ HsBracket (DecBrL (snd $2)))
                                      (mo $1:mc $3:fst $2) }

TypeBrackets.hs
  The parentheses are attached to the SynDecl span
  fix in ghc-exactprint


LiftedConstructors.hs
  Annotations are there, fix in exactprint.

LambdaCase.hs
  Curly braces attached to HsLamCase SrcSpan, fix in ghc-exactprint


DefaultTypeInstance.hs
   Trac #10307 / D842


InfixPatternSynonyms.hs
   Manage print order in GHC.PatSynBind for the InfixPatSyn variant.
     Should be la,ln,lb. Fix in ghc-exactprint

LiftedInfixConstructor.hs

    It needs the new D825, but in its absence we need to reconstruct the original
    SrcSpan through knowing the length of the prefix for VarBr, then call mark on it
    so the normal RdrName processing can take place. That's why the parens don't
    show up

OptSig.hs
  The AnnDcolon is attached to the PatBind, same as the AnnEqual
  Fix in ghc-exactprint

GADTRecords.hs
  #10309 D848



GHC tickets still to be done
----------------------------

MultiLineWarningPragma.hs
  #10313. Unlikely to be fixed for 7.12


  
Needs work
----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using GHC api-annotations 2015-04-17

In hand
-------

ListComprehensions.hs
    GHC annotations look fine. Weird bug. Probably related to layout marking
    on the HsLet

TypeFamilies.hs
    GHC annotations are fine, suspect some strange interaction with the
    NoLayoutRules immediately before mark GHC.AnnEqual in markTyFamEqn

Minimal.hs
    As before, needs hack in ghc-exactprint, proper fix in 7.12

MangledSemiLet.hs
  As before. Seems the AnnSemiSep is being attached to the lhs of the PatBind,
  rather than the PatBind as a whole

MultiLineWarningPragma.hs
  As before. ignore before 7.12

MangledSemiLet.hs
  PatBind gives lhs the SrcSpan of the whole bind
  D873

Requires GHC fix
----------------

TypeSignatureParens.hs
    mk_forall_ty lc exp  tvs (L _ (HsParTy ty)) = mk_forall_ty lc exp tvs ty
   discards the annotation
   resurrect D855? or rework it
   
DoubleForall.hs
   D833 needs attention, is not passing the annotations up
   updated, must merge into api-annotations


Needs triage
------------

### Failure in: 104
Minimal.hs
### Failure in: 109
Undefined6.hs
### Failure in: 114
Undefined11.hs
### Failure in: 118

========================================================================

Use GHC api-annotations3 2015-05-06 (16h00 version)


Minimal.hs
Undefined6.hs
Undefined11.hs
  BooleanFormula: Missing commas,parens. Annotations are there.


TypeBrackets.hs
  Annotations are there, seems to be a problem with nested type in HsWB.
  - Need to back out D823, the no_forall_ty makes it unnecessary
  
MultiLineWarningPragma.hs
  Targetting 7.12.1 only


========================================================================

Use GHC wip/api-annots 2015-05-09 

  TypeFamilies.hs
    FIXED: HsTyVar needed to use AnnName

  QuasiQuote.hs
    No, we are treating the "#{Foo .." part as if it is a comment, not part of the quote.

  Minimal.hs
  Undefined6.hs
  Undefined11.hs
    Still the BooleanFormula issue

  TemplateHaskell.hs
  THMonadInstance.hs
    Need to rework instance Annotate (GHC.HsSplice)

  MultiLineWarningPragma.hs
    As before, wait for 7.12

  UnicodeSyntax.hs
    FIXED Annlarrowtail / Annrarrowtail incorrect mapping.
    ITStar will have to wait for 7.12

  CorePragma.hs
    FIXED:Need to quote the string inside, Print issue

  UnicodeRules.hs
    The string we get has the right character in it,
    need to print it in a unicode-aware way

  RecordSemi.hs
    FIXED: Can be leading semis in a LetStmt

  TypeInstance.hs
    FIXED: Missing call to mark AnnInstance

  OveridingPrimitives.hs
    Need to rework the Annotate instance for RdrName
    
  SlidingDataClassDecl.hs
    Need to do a sortLocated annotate for ln and pats in a DataFamInstDecl.
    
  ExplicitNamespaces.hs
    FIXED. The annotations were connected to an AnnVal Span.

  DroppedComma.hs
    AnnComma attached to wrong element

    getAndRemoveAnnotationDelta needs to destructively get only the first
    annotation where there are multiple ones
    
  SlidingTypeSyn.hs
    SynDecl has spans that are too short, annotations odd. Needs attention.
    There are two issues
      1. The infix type definition means we need to sort the name and binder names
      2. Some parts are in parens, others not. The parens annotations are
         attached to the top level. We need to work them in somehow.
         Similar to booleanFormula issue.

  TypeBrackets4.hs
    Disconnected annotation in nested parens.
    Parens are also at the top level decl, work them in. Similar to SlidingTypeSyn


Needs GHC Fix
-------------

  TupleSections.hs
    Disconnected annotation for comma at (10,30) and others
    #10399

  *ImplicitTypeSyn.hs
    ctypedoc for HsIParamTy needs to match ctype
    #10399

  TypeBrackets2.hs
  GADTContext.hs
    Disconnected annotation in a ConDecl HsForAllTy. Context has a noloc
    Problem is mkGadtDecl when it combines contexts, the one on the left is sometimes empty.
    #10399
    
    
    
needs triage
------------
